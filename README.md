```bash
from cogi_quant.dataload import company_profile as profile
from cogi_quant.instrument import stock
  
# Method 1: initialize profile object using string
ABNB_profile = profile.CompanyProfile("Airbnb")

#Method 2: initialize profile object using Stock object
ABNB = stock.Stock("ABNB")
ABNB_profile = profile.CompanyProfile(ABNB)

# get a company summary
ABNB_profile.summary()

# get company chair of directors
ABNB_profile.get_chair()
```

  Access **quantitative company stock stats** like PE ratios, volume, beta, risk, etc.
```bash
from cogi_quant.dataload import quoting

# initalizing quoting
GOOGL_q = quoting.Quote("GOOGL")

# access GOOGL stock PE ratios
GOOGL_q.get_PE_trailing()
GOOGL_q.get_PE_forward()

# other stats
risk = GOOGL_q.overall_risk()
beta = GOOGL_q.get_beta()
day_volume = GOOGL_q.get_current_day_volume()
```

- üóÇÔ∏è **S&P 500 & Index Membership**  
  Easily pull S&P 500 constituents for index-level or sector-level analysis.
```bash
from cogi_quant.dataload import snp

health_care_securities = snp.get_securities_by_sector(sector="Health Care")
```

- üßÆ **Statistical & Technical Analysis**  
  Built-in tools for basic stats, rolling operations, market indicators, and more.

relative_strength_index = technicals.rsi(day_prices_by_minute, period=14)
macd = macd(day_prices_by_minute)
